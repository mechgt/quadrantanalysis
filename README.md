# Quadrant Analysis
Quadrant Analysis plugin for SportTracks (Desktop)

Quadrant Analysis is a plugin to extend the sports anaylysis software SportTracks. Perform advanced analysis using data captured from personal fitness devices (such as heartrate and other).

Analyze composition of a power track.  Power (and cadence) is broken down into components and plotted on a scatter plot.  Use this data to help target your training for an upcoming race.

This software was open-sourced after SportTracks desktop was discontinued, and all restrictions have been removed.

### Getting Started
Quadrant Analysis adds a new Detail Pane to your activities view (it's also accessible from reports view in similar manner.)  You'll need to select an activity that has both a power track and a cadence track to get any results.  These are the only 2 required data tracks.

A new help/introduction file has been added in this release as well.  Click the blue question mark for some more info describing the concepts of Quadrant Analysis (thanks DavidCHall!).

### Using Quadrant Analysis:
Now once you're on the detail page, you should set your athlete specific numbers in the orange box below.  The screenshot below should help identify the various aspects of the chart.

* **Power** should be set to your threshold power for this type of activity.
* **Range** is simply to give you a visual reference for how the power lines flow and the scale.  It does not have any impact on the calculations.  This controls the Red lines.
* **Cadence** should be set to your natural cadence.  This is the cadence that you naturally select while riding... the most comfortable cadence for you.
* **Crank Length** is the length of your crank arms measured in mm.  Typical values are 175, 172.5, and 170 mm.  It's measured from the center line of your bottom bracket to the center line of your pedals.

Summary data for each quadrant is displayed on the chart in the grey boxes.

* **Time** is total time spent in this quadrant
* **Percent** is percent of time
* **> Power** and **< Power** is relative to the blue threshold power line.  This is the time or percent in this quadrant (only applies to Q2 & Q4) and above or below the blue line.

To select multiple activities, place a check in the checkbox to 'pin' that activity to the chart.  Select your next activity and it will be overlaid on the chart.

Note that additional columns are available in the table by right-clicking on the column header and selecting "List Settings..."
